> [!todo] Create a new Query Note
> - [x] Use this template
> - [ ] Write a short description of the query in the frontmatter
> - [ ] Write the most basic version of the query possible. Keeping it simple and reduce it to the necessary makes it easier for others to understand the important parts of a query
> - [ ] If applicable, add one or multiple variants of the query and explain what they are doing - this could i.e. be an enhancement that makes the result better readable/even more useful
> - [ ] Add appropiate tags to the page 
> 	- [ ] If a DQL query: used query type (LIST, TABLE etc), data commands (FROM, WHERE, FLATTEN etc) and used [functions](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/functions/) - always with #dv in front, i.e. #dv/list 
> 	- [ ] If a dataviewjs query: #dv/dataviewjs  and every [dataviewjs](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/) or [data array](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/data-array/) function as a #dvjs tag, i.e. #dvjs/current 
> - [ ] Add your name in the contribution callout at the top - or remove the contribution callout, however you like it better! Mind, though: Before contributing queries from others, always ask for their permission.
> - [ ] Delete this callout :)
