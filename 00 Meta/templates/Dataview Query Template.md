> [!todo] Create a new Query Note
> - [x] Use this template
> - [ ] Write a short description of the query in the Frontmatter
> - [ ] Write the most basic version of the query possible. Keeping it simple and reduce it to the necessary makes it easier for others to understand the important parts of a query
> - [ ] If applicable, add one or multiple variants of the query and explain what they are doing - this could i.e. be an enhancement that makes the query better readable/even more useful
> - [ ] Add the used query type (LIST, TABLE, TASK, CALENDAR) as tags (always with #dv in front, i.e. #dv/LIST)
> - [ ] Add all used datacommands (FROM, WHERE, SORT, LIMIT, GROUPBY, FLATTEN) as tags (with dv prefix) 
> - [ ] Add all used [functions](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/functions/) as tags (with dv prefix)
> - [ ] Add your name in the contribution callout at the top - or remove the contribution callout, however you like it better! Mind, though: Before contributing queries from others, always ask for their permission!
> - [ ] Delete this callout :)
