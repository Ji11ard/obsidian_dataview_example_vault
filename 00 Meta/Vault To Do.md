# Vault To Do

## Organization

- [ ] Think of a useful folder structure - current structure under 20 Dataview Queries is not really feasable
- [ ] Write MOCs or similar that encourage exploration, the current ones are awful (sorry!)
- [ ] Introduce a possibility to group queries that belongs to a topic, i.e. listing bullet points, habit tracking, task management, ... 

## Example Data
- [ ] Add more example data for "Collection" queries (book/game/food notes)
- [ ] Add tags for querying

## Queries
- [ ] Add the example queries from the dataview documentation (and fitting data)
- [ ] Add LIST queries that showcase the basic syntax
- [ ] Add TABLE queries that showcase the basic syntax
- [ ] Add TASK queries that showcase the basic syntax
- [ ] Add CALENDAR queries that showcase the basic syntax
- [ ] Add the examples from the Dataview documentation (with back reference) for easy try-outs
