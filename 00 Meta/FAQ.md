# FAQ

> [!question]- Who is the maintainer of this vault?
> I'm Sam, a regular Obsidian user. You'll sometimes catch me in the dataview thread of the Obsidian Discord. I hope I won't stay the only maintainer for long - this was AB1908 idea in the first place, anyway.

> [!question]- Why does this vault exists?
> Discord is not the best place to store information for later access and while there exists an extensive Forum Thread for sharing Dataview queries, it is not super intuitive and user friendly to search in it. The idea is to instead everages Obsidians immense strength in storing data and make it accessible.

> [!question]- Why is this not part of the Obsidian Hub?
> While I'd be delighted to get a reference to this vault inside the hub somewhen, not integrating it right away as multiple reasons:
> - This vault contains a vast amount of useless example data and I don't think the Hub is the right place for such data
> - To my knowledge, Dataview Queries do not render on publish instances, so you'd need to download the vault anyway
> - Dataview shines when you tailor it to your need. In order to do so, it's most helpful if you can play around with data and queries - thus have a local copy of the vault
> - Right now, this vault is only a planned project without much value just yet. It should mature to something valuable before we put it somewhere

> [!question]- I have a cool query. How do I add it?
> Nice! Create a new note in the appropiate folder - depending on which type of query you want to share. You'll find a template you can use [[Dataview Query Template|here]], that gives you a bit more guidance. Please create a new note per independent query - if the query returning the same result and doing things just a _tad_ differently, add it as a "Variant". Refer to [[README#Contributing]] for infos how to share your cool query!

> [!question]- I'm trying to achieve something with dataview, but it doesnt work!
> Hop over to the [Obsidian Community](https://obsidian.md/community) and ask for help either in the forum or Discord. The Obsidian Community is a very helpful lot, so go ask them!
